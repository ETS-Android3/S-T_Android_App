# S-T_Android_App
Students and tutors is an application made by me for the Human Computer Interaction Classes, that I have taken during my mobility semester in Aveiro, Portugal. The application itself serves as a advertising media for people who are looking for students and tutors for private lessons. It has been designed with the use of adobe XD, evaluated using various methods such as cognitive walkthrough and heuristic evaluation, then later developed using android studio (Java) software.
